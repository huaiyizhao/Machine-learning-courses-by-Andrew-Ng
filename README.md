  Answers to the program assignments of Machine learning courses taught by Andrew Ng in stanford, offered by coursera.

  These files are my answers to the assignments which had received full scores from coursera.

  I hope it will give you some hints when getting stuck in particular sections. But I highly recommend whoever refer to these codes      DO NOT copy any of them.
