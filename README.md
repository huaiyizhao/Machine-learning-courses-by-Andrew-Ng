# Machine-learning-courses-by-Andrew-Ng


  Answers to the program assignments of Machine learning courses taught by Andrew Ng in stanford, offered by coursera.

  These files are my answers to the assignments which had received full scores from coursera.

  I hope it will give you some hints when getting stuck in particular sections. But I highly recommend whoever refer to these codes      DO NOT copy any of them.

  You are welcomed to find any ERROR or give different implement.

  There are some small bugs in ex5: 

  >The terminal reports warnings when executing "LearningCurve" part.

  >Figure 1 in polynomial fit is not similar as the example provided in ex5.pdf.

  However, I submit my code successfully and recieve full scores.

  Leave comments here if you know what's wrong with the code or better implementation.
